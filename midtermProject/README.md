# WHACK-A-MOLE
Moles randomly pop up among 9 holes! Try to hit the mole with a hammer by clicking them and earn points!

### Motivation
I decided to create this game since I had good memories playing whack-a-mole with the machin in the streets with my friends. By making a digitalized version of the game, I thought I could add my taste through color choices, images of mole, etc. It means a lot to me to recreate this game, which is one of my favorite childhood memories.<br>

### Instruction
I created this game based on classic rules of the original game. But I added different types of moles, which will give you different score when hitting them. Also, if you hit the flower, you will lose 10 points.

Simply, you win by reaching 100 points. You lose if the score reaches -30!
