# WHACK-A-MOLE
Moles randomly pop up among 9 holes! Try to hit the mole with a hammer by clicking them and earn points!

### Motivation
I decided to create this game since I had good memories playing whack-a-mole with the machin in the streets with my friends. By making a digitalized version of the game, I thought I could add my taste through color choices, images of mole, etc. It means a lot to me to recreate this game, which is one of my favorite childhood memories.
