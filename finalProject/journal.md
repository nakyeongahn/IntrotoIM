# T-rex Dinosaur Game

### April 12
The basic concept of my game is a T-rex game. <br>
Yes, the game that pops up on a Chrome window when you have problems with your internet connection. <br>

I would like to make this game through processing and control the movement of dinosaur through switches on arduino board.
