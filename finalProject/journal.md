Idea: Make the RC car with ultrasonic sensor to avoid obstacles automatically. To detect obstacles in a wide angle range, a servo motor can be used to rotate the ultrasonic sensor.

I drew the schematic; the Arduino board should be connected to a servo motor, an ultrasonic sensor, and two DC motors.

I built the first version of RC car with cardboard boxes. It failed because the sensors and motors are not fixed to the strcture. Components fall apart while the device makes movements. I should come up with another material for the structure of the vehicle.

I built the second version of the car with the acrylic plate. Now, it is much more stable. Placing the ultrasonic sensor on top of the servo motor was the most tricky part. I ended up using glue gun to first fix the cardboard box plate with the servomotor. And then placed ultrasonic sensor using tapes and glue gum. Because of the weight of the ultrasonic sensor, the sensor kept facing down. So I added some paper to keep the balance.
