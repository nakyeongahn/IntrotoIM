# T-rex Dinosaur Game

### April 12
The basic concept of my game is a T-rex game. <br>
Yes, the game that pops up on a Chrome window when you have problems with your internet connection. <br>

##### Interaction between Arduino and Proceesing

1. The movement of the T-rex would be controlled by the switches on the Arduino board.
2. After certain score is achieved by the player, a distance sensor can be used to make the T-rex fly for 10 seconds.
3. Every time the player gains points, the LED light will be turned on.
4. A buzzer can be added to the board to play the sounds when the score is gained. (Maybe processing itself can play more sophisticated sounds)
