### Weekly Assignment ###
#### Week1-January 26: Self Portrait ####
In the self portrait, I wanted include some of my preferences. As my favorite flower is sunflower, I tried to draw it on the clothes. The colors were also chosen based on my love for pastel colors. I used pastel green color for the background and pastel blue for my clothes. I had the short hair for over 5 years now, so I also included that in the self-portrait. Moreover, although it is very trivial, I added some cheek blusher, which is my favorite make-up. Overall, in the portrait, I added things that I love the most.<br>

#### Week2-February 2: A Growing Circle ####
The big pink circle follows your mouse while other little circles are randomly moving around the window. I added more vibrance by changing the color of small circles regularly. The main circle will get bigger when it collides with other small circles. Once the main circle reaches its maximum radius and gets bigger than the window, the motion will stop.<br>
