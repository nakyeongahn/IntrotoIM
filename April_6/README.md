# Arduino Assignment 3: Musical Instrument - Mini Piano

I made a mini piano with a buzzer and switches. There are three switches, each of which plays C or D or E note. <br>
If you start the program, the melody for "Mary Little Lamb" will be played, the song you can play with the three notes that switches play through the buzzer. While you push the switch to make a sound, the lamb (attached to the servo motor) will make moves. <br>
