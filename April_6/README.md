# Arduino Assignment 3: Musical Instrument - Mini Piano

I made a mini piano with a buzzer and switches. There are three switches, each of which plays C or D or E note. <br>
If you start the program, the melody for "Mary Little Lamb" will be played, the song you can play with the three notes that switches play through the buzzer. While you push the switch to make a sound, the lamb (attached to the servo motor) will make moves. <br>

Materials Used:<br>
3 Switches<br>
1 Buzzer<br>
1 Servo Motor<br>

### Process
I tried to make a piano and the simple song I came up with is "Mary Little Lamb." I chose this song as only three notes are needed to play this song and it is a famous children song.

1. I found the piano sheet for the song. <br>

  The note is from here: https://www.letsplaykidsmusic.com/mary-had-a-little-lamb-easy-piano-music/
  
2. I drew the lamb that would be attached to the servo motor.
